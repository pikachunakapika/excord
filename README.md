# Excord
## Gnome Shell Extension for Discord

#### !!! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !!!!
This might get your account banned or something...I don't know!

#### Status & Todo
It is working but code needs some clean up and restructuring.

Message layouting is often broken for fancy text formattings or long messages.

- Filter muted objects
- More filters maybe (e.g. filter bot messages)
- Display inline images when it's not in the embed property (plain url message)
- Display inline images when it's in an attachment property
- Send message to user (extend destination selection for @users)

#### Usage
- Clone repository to ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/excord@pikachunakapika
- Set your token in the extension settings.
- Enable extension
